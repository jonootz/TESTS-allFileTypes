It includes several features that you might use in online output, and the content and files have been designed to maximize single-sourcing capabilities. This template starts you out with two HTML5 targets and a skin that has responsive output based on the device width. This means the content display changes automatically depending on the device (browser, tablet, or mobile phone). You can add other kinds of targets and skins if you like."
